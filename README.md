# Turner And Townsend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.0.

This project uses pnpm instead of npm. Once project has been cloned at the terminal run `pnpm i` to install Node packages.

## Improvements

Given more time,

- I would like to have focused on getting a better mobile layout.
- Used Signals instead of decorated inputs/outputs to improve performance
- Added additional functionality:
  - a search facility.
  - a details page.

## Comments

Great little project to work on.
